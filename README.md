## 👋 Description about the Project

- I have built a Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, JS, and Visual Studio Code. The project required me to use my web development and designing skills to create a website that showcases my skills, experience, and services.

- The website has a clean and modern design that reflects my personal brand and style. It features a homepage that introduces me and my skills, an "About Me" section that provides more information about me, a "Skills" section that highlights my technical and soft skills, a "Services" section that highlights the services I offer, and a "Contact Me" section that allows visitors to reach out to me.

- To create the website, I used HTML to structure the content, CSS to design the interface and make it visually appealing, and JavaScript to implement interactive features such as a responsive menu and a contact form.

- Visual Studio Code was my IDE of choice for this project, which allowed me to write and edit my code efficiently and effectively. The website is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, making it accessible to visitors using desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.
